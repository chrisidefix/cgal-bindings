# History #
Trying to give access to the CGAL library to non-C++ user has already been done by several projects:
  * Bindings for the [Ipe extensible drawing editor](http://tclab.kaist.ac.kr/ipe/) are distributed with [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org/Manual/latest/doc_html/cgal_manual/CGAL_ipelets/Chapter_main.html).
  * [cgal-python](http://cgal-python.gforge.inria.fr) was the first attempt to make CGAL available to Python users, but is now no longer maintained.
  * [cglab](http://cglab.gforge.inria.fr) was the first attempt to provide access to CGAL algorithm in [Scilab](http://www.scilab.org/). In the context of the 2011 Google summer of code, the Scilab team upgraded the bindings and now hosts them on their [forge](http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/cglab/).
