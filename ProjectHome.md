The CGAL Bindings project allows to use some packages of  [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org), the Computational Algorithms Library, in languages other than C++, as for example Java and Python. The bindings are implemented with SWIG.

<font color='red'>This project is still experimental and more packages will be added.</font>
